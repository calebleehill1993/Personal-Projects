<summary><b>2022-11-08 - Ad Hoc Data Latency Analysis</b></summary>
<b>Summary</b>
<br>
Invoicing is currently beginning 5 days into the month in order to capture data
that is processed late. This happens due to devices being disconnected from the
internet when an event or install happens. We process the correct time for the 
event or install, only it comes in much later when they've connected back to the
internet. The question is whether it will impact invoicing to start this process
on the 3rd day of the month rather than the 5th. Are there enough transactions being
processed late to cause changes in the invoices themselves when processed at 3 days
vs 5 days into the next month.
