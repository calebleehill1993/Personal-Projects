The idea is to create an app that you can save recipes from the internet to and then select the recipes you want to cook for the week. It will give you a list of all the ingredients needed for all of the recipes you want to make together. This way, you know exactly what to buy from the store so you're not left without a certain ingredient when you go to make your meals.
