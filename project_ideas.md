<details>
<summary><b>Recipe Manager</b></summary>
The idea is to create an app that you can save recipes from the internet 
to and then select the recipes you want to cook for the week. It will give 
you a list of all the ingredients needed for all of the recipes you want 
to make together. This way, you know exactly what to buy from the store 
so you're not left without a certain ingredient when you go to make your 
meals.

<summary><b>Home Depot Price Tracking</b></summary>
My Father-In-Law would like to track certain Home Depot prices over time to
purchase items in bulk when prices are low.

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Elizabeth's Website</b></summary>
My wife would like a website to blog about her crafty things. It uses my
domain, https://thecraftroom.calebleehill.com.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Portfolio/Personal Website</b></summary>
I'd like to have a website where I can share some of my favorite projects
and other things I've done. Ideally, it would connect to GitHub and 
YouTube to display some cool things that I've done and help me to
keep a record of my achievements.

<summary><b>Housing Prices VS Income over time</b></summary>
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Fat Secret Weight and Food Analysis</b></summary>
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Something with Yahoo Finance Data</b></summary>
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Make a Video Game</b></summary>
I've thought about using PyGame, but that just seems too low level and 
time consuming so perhaps I could use an engine like GoDot or something.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Katamino Algorithm</b></summary>
There is a wooden puzzle game that has something like 500 variations. It
would be cool to create a puzzle solver for this using matrices and numpy.
We could also have it drawn out using matplotlib or something like it. 
This is all, but finished. Just need to wrap it up and document it.

<details>
<summary><b>Southwest Low Fair Tracker</b></summary>
I want to be able to scrape Southwest's website for flights that meet
certain parameters and then have emails sent to me tracking flights.
This is mostly done and served its purpose, but is not very presentable.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><b>Task Tracking Website Application</b></summary>
The idea for this comes from the fact that there aren't any apps that track
tasks in a way that really makes sense. I want to have an infinite number
of nested subtasks that can be collapsed and expanded, as well as moved
under other tasks. I'd also like some task details. I'll use this as an 
example.
<ul>
<details>
<summary>This is subtask.</summary>
With details under it.
<ul>
<details>
<summary>This is another task.</summary>
With details under it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>This is another task.</summary>
With details under it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>This is another task.</summary>
With details under it.
</details>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary>This is another task.</summary>
With details under it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>This is another task.</summary>
With details under it.
</details>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Grocery Tracker (coding and electronics)</b></summary>
I'd like to have a system to keep track of how much food we have, specifically for
canned good and other things in the pantry. This would utilize simple digital
number readouts for each item as well as add and minus buttons. It would be hooked
to some microprocessor that could utilize the wifi and update a list either on my
webserver or in a Google Keep note or something. This way, we always know how much
of each item we have and can make purchases accordingly.
